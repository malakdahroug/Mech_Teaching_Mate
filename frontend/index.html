            <h2>Mechatronics Teaching Mate</h2>
            <p>As a Mechatronics student I have grown very fond of PLC programming, control systems and the Industrial
                Automation industry as a whole, which is why I chose a final project that would allow me to further
                tackle problems the industry is facing today.</p>

            <p>In order to overcome the given problems faced by many students as well as professionals when programming
                complex industrial systems, I have developed an application that allows the user to input the sequence
                of a system and automatically generate its corresponding code. The application also acquires the feature
                of embedding faults within the generated code for the user to solve. It also includes a feature that
                allows a user to simulate a given sequence through the use of a simulated PLC and a connection to the
                applications such as TIA Portal and FluidSIM. Information on what is required to utilise each of the
                features is detailed when the registration and login stages have been completed, within the Instructions
                tab.</p>
            <p>This application aims to help programmers practice their fault-finding skills when programming industrial
                systems as well as reduce the time and effort required to programme complex systems and overall ease the
                process of programming within the Industrial Automation field.</p>
